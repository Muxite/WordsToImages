# WordsToImages
 Type a sentence, each word becomes an image from Google Images
 Uses Selenium Webdriver with Chromedriver.
 - Type in a sentence, it breaks the sentence into words.
 - it searches up each word on Google Images
 - it returns each file labeled with a number starting at 0 (in order)
 By the way, the text used to generate the sample images was :
 "Jesse, we need to cook", resulting in 5 images for 5 words.

 User must edit code in main so that the location of Webdriver
 matches that of their version of webdriver. Webdriver must be the same as
 the user's version of Chrome. This code uses Xpaths to identify images,
 making it prone to failure as HTML on sites is modified. This project is
 more of a framework for a simple, but useful menial task that can be
 automated with Selenium.
 I have made a video on this:
